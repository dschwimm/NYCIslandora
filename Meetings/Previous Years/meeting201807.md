* Individual Member description of Islandora experience.  Each member of the NYCIslandora group discussed his/her institution's implementation of Islandora.
* Open discussion and questions. It was a lively discussion that covered many topics and questions, including:
  * Islandora Community - how to interact with and learn from the community
  * Using one system for multi-system needs so that library, museum, and institution are not all on different systems. Also, can the system handle audio/video, etc.
  *  Possible vendors working with Islandora.
  * Batch loading/processing of large amounts of material.
  * Implementation and Configuration -
  * ISLE project
  * Content migration - migration can be easier from one open-source system to another as compared to migrating form a proprietary system to an open-source system.
