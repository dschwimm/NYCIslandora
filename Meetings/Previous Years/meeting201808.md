  * Possible dates: 10/24, 10/31, 11/14 - Thomas has been in contact with John and the date that works best is 11/14.
  * Content - discuss on open source, metadata and ways of ingesting (advantages of different methods)
  * Technical - confirm access to computer; setup sandbox
* Panel Discussion Planning - Didn't discuss much about this.  Need to revisit.
* [Open Repositories](http://www.or2018.net) - Diego discussed his experience and presentation
  * Diego presented about multi-importer; metadata, mapping; received good feedback
  * There were presentations from Islandora Foundataion, Lyrasis, IIIF
  * Many presentations were about migration - institutions doing mass migration from one system to another.  It seemed to be an overall theme and trying to solve migration issues.  This may be an area where more content-focused discussions can occur since much of the current discussion is focused on the technical. 
* Updates from the field
