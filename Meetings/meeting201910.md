## AGENDA & NOTES
 * Welcome & Introductions
 * Meeting schedule
 * Current Project Updates
	* Migrations and Islandora 8
		* ICG/Barnard trying to do work around ISLE for Islandora 8, schools' metadata staff working on metadata transformations 
		* Others are considering options: DiscoveryGarden branch of Islandora 7; Islandora 8; Archipelago. Trying wait to see where other people are at before making a commitment.
    * We talked about updates: migrations, new audio collections, etc.
 * Workshops
	* Workshop ideas are in the [wiki](https://github.com/rnaughtonwk/NYCIslandora/wiki/Workshops). 
	* Something on metadata, more general interest; METRO is not interested in Islandora workshops currently but does want to support a series of workshops on digital collections
	* Solr workshop - Karen will reach out to her contact to repeat a workshop at METRO or do a webinar. Robin is also talking to Audrey about this
	* OpenRefine - Karen is doing this workshop with someone else. 
	* TWIG - maybe Diego would want to teach this?
	* Best practices: File format workshop?	Sharing best practices across archivists, developers, etc.
	* Surveying landscape of digital collections platforms/options. DAMs, open source systems, vendor systems. Like a live version of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cXOug3qM0pNNeD_wssiVEv9c0W1Y5I1VDTnSPTk7fb4/edit#gid=0)
	* Future: something about MODS to RDF process--a meetup/working group? Could be a webinar with the Islandora MIG. Digital preservation?
