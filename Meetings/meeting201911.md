##  NOTES
### Workshops 
* **Solr Workshop (In Progress)** - Karen has taken the lead on organizing this workshop.  She has reached out to both the instructor and METRO to discuss a workshop in the Spring 2020.
* **OpenRefine Workshop (In Progress)** - Karen is also taking lead on this workshop and will be discussing details with instructor after the Thanksgiving holiday.
* **Other Workshops** - The team discuss the other workshops listed in the wiki and how we can plan to do some more over the next year.
  * MODS - this is handled elsewhere by a number of different methods.  People can easily find online classes, videos, etc. to learn the basics of MODS.
   * Archipelago - this is still of interest and it may be good to get a hands-on session on how it works and ways to deploy.  Robin to speak with Diego about this.
   * Data Workshops - very broad as it now stands. A focus on a specific project or an outcome of the workshop can help to narrow the focus.  It was discussed as a potential for the NYC DH Week coming the first week of February 2020.  Also thinking about digital workflows.
    * Islandora Content Models - a workshop on how the current content models work.  Each organization uses a few of the content models and is interested in learn how to use others that will help to enhance their collections.  For example, the audio or video solution packs.  Also, since content models cover many solution packs, the idea for this workshop can include the creators discussing the content model during one of the regular meetings of NYCIslandora.
    * Basic Introduction to Islandora Workshop - build on the workshop done at Queens College. Enhance and update to offer again in 2020.
    * System Integration Workshops - ArchiveSpace & Islandora /Archivmatic & Islandora
    
### Notes from the Field
* Deena - working on 150 photographs from a larger collection.  Working through some challenges regarding intellectual control and tracking of photographs (and duplicates) in a larger collection that can be up to 30K images.  Still in the process of deciding the best way to tackle the process of identifying and tracking the images for digitization.
* Margo -  nothing today.
* Henry - working on the metadata and organization of subway photograph collection.  May organize based on the collection's archival structure.
* Robin - working on spreadsheet ingest for Resurrectionist ingest.  Also working on user research of website and Matz postcard collection.
