## NOTES

### Ideas & Plans for 2020: Workshops
* **Solr Workshop (Scheduled)** - The Solr workshop is set for March 30, 2020 at METRO. Event info: [SOLR for Newbies](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/solr-for-newbies-tickets-85879575121) 
* **OpenRefine Workshop (In Progress)**  - Karen is still interested in doing this workshop.  Will need to follow-up.
* **Basic Introduction to Islandora Workshop** - Thomas will look into whether Queens College would like to do this workshop again.  Also, we discussed contacting library schools to see if they are interested.
* **Islandora Content Models** - for this workshop the discussion turned to the NYCIslandora group learning as well as leading.  The group is interested in learning more about content models.  We can potentially organized workshops during our meeting time to enhance knowledge within the group. 
* **Data Workshops** - Similarly, the group wants to learn more before doing a workshop for others.  The discussion landed on metadata and different approaches to doing metadata for digital collections.  We discussed what has worked and what has not in our different processes.  Coming out of the discussion, we decided that each person would do a case study focused on one collection to share with the group.  This way, we will learn from each other and have the case studies for a future workshop.  In addition, we also discussed developing some documentation/suggested guidelines regarding metadata that we can share with others based on the case studies. 

### Notes from the Field
* Everyone showed the collections they were currently working during the discussion.
* **Thomas:** Working on media studies department collections - will help with the build-out of student portfolios, which in turn will help with how the archive is supporting students.
* **Henry:** Continuing to work on the subway construction photograph project. Has ingested ~6000 photographs and many more to go.  Spoke about the challenges of adding the map to the photographs.  Some of the coordinates work well when there is an exact address, but not so well when there are single street names such as Broadway.
* **Deena:** Continuing to work on Historic photographs and exploring facets for personal name.  Have done some work with video and audio datastreams
* **Robin:** Launched Matz Hospital postcards collection and starting to work on digital preservation plan.
