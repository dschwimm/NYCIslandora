### Metadata Presentation & Discussion
The metadata presentation was very informative and walked through the process of identifying, developing, and enhancing metadata so that the digital collection can provide users with good information. There were many takeaways but here are a few ideas coming out of the discussion:
* Make sure you estimate your collection appropriately before you ask for money.
* Find ways to combine tasks so that you don' t have to go through the physical items multiple times if you can accomplish more than one task with a review.
* Think of ways you can document the work that goes into preparing metadata for digital objects so that the work process is better understood by future teams working on the collection.
