METRO hiring metadata person;  - METRO members will be invited to be part of the move from DCMNY to Archipelago.

## Metadata Discussion  (Deena)
The presentation was from the manuscript collection, which included non-roman language material and focused on metadata challenges/issues
  * Names - name structure - parsing the names - name parts - came up with a solution  - twig template - a form of the name that would display name - worked nicely for the most part.
  * Date - added another display date in the date other field; not sure if that's the best solution
  * Genre - created vocabulary that's consistent across the system - have one genre and thinking about adding additional genres.  Other members of the group have used multiple genres and shared examples.
  * Sub-collections - still working on getting sub-collections to display the structure of the collection hierarchy

## Migrations
* Start thinking about migration and planning to move to a new system.
* Drupal 7 has another year, which gives you two years
* Pushing to the next step - get vendor to deploy Islandora 8 and test early

## Next Steps - NYCIslandora Future
  * Good to continue meeting after Robin's departure from NYAM.
  * Make a standing meeting where people can join as available each month.
  * Shorter meetings - with everyone working remote, change the meetings from 2hrs to 1hr. There was multiple support for the proposal.
  * Consider opening the group to other systems for discussion.
  * New conveners for the group:
      * Henry Raine, New-York Historical Society
      * Deena Schwimmer, Yeshiva University
